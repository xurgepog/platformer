# [08-02-2025] Day 28: Going back to advanced tiles idea
- Want to return to the previous idea.
- This is primarily due to the idea of having an expandable set up being one of my main goals.
- I will probably not introduce the previously discussed entities for some time, but want to be able to eventually.
- The rest will continue as usual.
- Added protection to the main branch to try and make work cycle more realistic.
- Accidently merged in terminal this time, want to push then merge via github for practice, like what was being done previously.
