# Platformer Game with Physics

This is a side project where I am building a platformer game that incorporates basic physics mechanics, such as **projectile motion**. The project is still in the early stages, and the specifics of the game are still being decided.

## Project Goal
- Create a platformer game with physics-based mechanics, including **projectile motion**.
- The game will include realistic physics features like gravity and collisions.

## Logbook
Iâ€™m keeping a design log to track key decisions and progress. You can check it out [here](design-log.md).

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure **Java 17** is installed.
3. Run the following command within the app directory:
   ```bash
   gradle run
